# Quick Quirky Quiz

Hi! Welcome to Fun with Quizzes! 

## Welcome!

Do you ever wonder what type of mushroom you are? Or what your fictional name is? If so, and if otherwise, this is the right game for you!
## The What and How
You will be asked questions and you will have to choose one of the options given.
You they can move onto the next question and it gives you your score as you go on. At the end of each question set, you get your points and therefore the result (e.g. you are a spring mushroom). Then you move onto the next question set to find out other things like fictional names or verbs etc.

Once you have answered all the questions, a sentence is created with all the words you have gotten from the results section.

-  e.g. You are a spring mushroom on the island of hakuna matata, you name is oompa Loompa and you are eating a minecraft mushroom

There are a range of different questions and each player can try the quiz several times with different answers to get a new funny story.
## Enjoy!
Hope you have fun playing!

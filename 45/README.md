# Rescue Mission

## About the Game
The story of Rescue Mission follows a 16-year-old girl named Carmen, who has been living in the zombie apocalypse for the past four years. Living with a group of older survivors, her one true friend was her dog Bartholomew who is a five-year-old Newfoundland dog who she has had since he was a puppy.

The events of the story start right after the tutorial level. It introduces Carmen as she explains her situation. Both characters really complement each other, and they depend on each other for survival.

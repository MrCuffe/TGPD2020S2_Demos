# Fight Night

## Description
Welcome to the ring! You are here for one reason, and one reason only: to fight. Use a combination of moves to outsmart and outwork your opponent, knock them out or defeat them by other means. Watch out however, because if you don't play it well enough, you may well get knocked out yourself!
## How to Play :
Once you have loaded into the game, it will prompt you with three difficulty levels: Easy, Medium, and Hard. Choose the difficulty level that you believe you can win at, albeit with somewhat of a struggle. If you input something that doesn't match with a difficulty however, you will be met with an unpleasant surprise! After the difficulty has been chosen, you will be given with a list of inputs, and each input matches an attack you can perform, or a block. After you have made your choice, your opponent will make theirs and you will both be damaged, or not be damaged depending on the input. This cycle continues until one fighter is knocked out, or cannot continue through other methods. Enjoy!

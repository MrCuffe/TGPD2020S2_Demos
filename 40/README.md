*Introduction to Games Programming and Data Science 2020*

## Description of Game:
In a world of mythical creatures and material, you have been appointed to armistice the ongoing Pokémon war. Defeat the attacking Pokémon and have the chance to capture them to build a collection. Visit the merchandise store to purchase food, medicinal healing potions and enchanted arrows to aid you in battle. Rescue the villages to become a champion and excel in combat. Players are given the flexibility of choosing their way how to confront objectives and interact with items. The goal is to win as many battles, but this is not as easy as it sounds to be. The incoming attacks will damage the player’s health at a random count. So, it is up to the player how they will handle themselves and sustain their health levels throughout the Game. This is the main priority to win the Game and is all up to the player’s actions to approach their battles.

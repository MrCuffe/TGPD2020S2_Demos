# Murder squares

## Aim of the game
The aim of the game is to get the highest possible score, this is done by touching the yellow circle over and over. You must do this while avoiding red squares which will end the game upon contact. 

## Headphone Warning -- sound can be loud

### Note: the game briefly flashes 'game over' when in contact with the red square then ends the game.

# Shooter game


## Description

This game is a type of space-themed bullet hell shooter game. The player will control a spaceship that will encounter different enemies and objects that either float or fly around. Once the spaceship touches an enemy or object, the player will lose a health and the once the player's health reaches 0, they will either have to quit or restart. The player will earn points through staying alive and can earn extra points by destroying enemies or gaining power-ups. These power-ups affect the type and firing rate of the spaceship. The game will also keep track of the playerâ€™s score that will increase when you destroy enemies and as time goes by. 

## Controls

WASD or arrow keys to move. Spacebar to shoot.

## How to Play
Shoot enemies that fly or float by while avoiding touching them at the same time. The boxes that occasionally fly by grants the spaceship powerups if you manage to come into contact with them.

{Dr. Williams}

I was told earlier this morning that (player_name) was unable to make it out of the ship alive.

The remaining soldiers evacuated the ship with no cure and no way of destroying it completely.

One careless lab staff member left the quarantine door open, so Squad 256 were able to escape.

Black Fever spread quickly and we had no hope of finding a cure.

The intersolar government was quick to abandon Earth, in fear of having the whole solar system contaminated.
 
I was valuable enough of an asset that they escorted me to Mars.

I promised to never speak of (player_name) or Black Fever again.

THE END.

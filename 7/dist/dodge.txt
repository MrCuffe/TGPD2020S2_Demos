-----> YOU DODGE

I roll to the left, hoping that it would pass by me.

I'm mistaken. It hears my movements and moves faster towards me. 

I throw the weapon I have to the opposite end of the room. 

The large thud attracts the alien and I am able to move away safely.

As it walks to the gun, I slowly start crawling towards the glass cage containing the antidote.

It's sealed tight.

{You}
1. Break the glass
2. Don't break the glass

The alien turns and for a split second, I see the same disfigured kind of face as I had witnessed at the labs. The resemblance is too alike to be undeniable...

Were these aliens not really aliens, as the intersolar government had told us?!

I fall to the floor in shock. The thud alerts the alien, and it runs towards me at a rapid speed.

I search frantically for a weapon, but I have none. The alien tackles me, wrapping its hands around my throat.

YOU DIED.

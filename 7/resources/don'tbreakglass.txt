----> YOU DON'T BREAK THE GLASS

[+1 Mission Self-Destruct]
[No Lives Lost]

//
I shouldn't try to break the glass, I might make noise and even worse, spill the antidote.

There should be a smarter way of opening the cage...
//

After seconds of searching, I find a lever positioned behind the cage. 

I pull it down and the liquid freezes, molding itself around the antidote. 

There's a quiet hiss as the glass cage opens. 

With ease, I take the container from the frozen liquid.

I'm so focused on getting the antidote that I don't notice the alien behind me, closing in.

I need to do something!

Frantically, I look around for anything that could save me.

There's a button for the alarm and another for something else. 

{You}
1. Press the blue button
2. Sound the alarm

## About the game
**Educational, elementary, personalised** 
This game isn’t like most. This game is more on the educational side and is meant to open primary school students into thinking more creatively and critically. Children will be tested on unorthodox letter and number questions which will progressively get harder. Each year level will get a personalised experience however the amount of praise and fun art will be standard throughout. Questions the player might face could look like, “Unscramble the these letters ‘obok’. (answer- book)”. Questions for the numbers game could be as simple as “what’s 5 * 6” or “what’s 2% of 100”, etc. This game will be short but beneficial and totally customizable by the user. Students will have complete control over how many questions they want to set as a goal and which subject they want to challenge themselves on. With an engaging platform, students will be excited to learn and expand their thinking styles.
## How to Play :
1. You must enter your grade, mood and subject of study to receive a personalised learning structure. 
2. You need to answer all the questions before moving on to another subject. Answers need to be in English

# Mirror jump
## Description:
A unique take on your typical platformer game. The screen is divided into two halves and on the bottom everything is fairly normal. You have a charicter you directly control and you have to jump along platforms to get to the flag at the end of the level. Unlike a regular platformer this isn't the only thing you have to pay attention to as the top half has another player who does the opposite of what you tell it and while navigating the bottom player over the jumps you also have to be watching the top player and making sure he doesn't hit an obsticle and die.
## How to Play :
Its simple. Use the WASD keys to move the bottom player and the top player will do the exact opposite. Get to the flag at the end of each level by navigating over platforms with the bottom player while not touching obsticals with the top player.
